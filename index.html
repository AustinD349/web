        <P id = "main">"SpongeBob SquarePants" is a film directed by Sherman Cohen, Walter Duchs, Sam Henderson, Paul Tibbitt, etc., Tom Kenny, Bill Fagerbaker, Roger Bupas, etc. The dubbed American comedy animation was broadcast on Nick International Children's Channel on July 17, 1999. <br>
          The storyline of "SpongeBob SquarePants" mainly revolves around the protagonist SpongeBob SquarePants and his good friend Pai Daxing, neighbor Squidward Brother, boss Crab Boss and others. The scene is set on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, a city called Beechburg. On January 30, 2005, the film won the "Best TV Animation Production" award at the 32nd Annie Awards. <br>
          In addition to the cartoon scenes and characters fixedly depicted, this animation will also be interspersed with some real objects or characters: for example, David Hasselhoff, who has appeared in "Baywatch" and "Knight Rider", as himself Starred in a few episodes. However, the content of SpongeBob SquarePants cartoons is basically irrelevant to marine knowledge, and even exaggerated to the extent that it is completely inconsistent with science and common sense, such as making a fire under the sea and taking a bath under the sea.</P>
