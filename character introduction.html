          <h2>SpongeBob SquarePants</h2>
          <p>The character and protagonist of "SpongeBob SquarePants". A yellow oblong sponge with a body composed like a cleaning sponge. Birthday is July 14, 1986. Has two left hands with four fingers each. The main clothing is brown shorts, white shirt and red tie. With an immortal body, no matter how the body is destroyed, it can be restored to its original state. Although there is normal feeding, pure filter-feeding seawater can continue to survive. The physical strength is weak, and the so-called dumbbells are actually plush toys.</p>

          <h2>Patrick</h2>
          <p>Pink starfish. The IQ is extremely low, and the mind and body are only connected by plugs. He messes up everything, but is amazing at sailing, and lives under a large round rock. Lazy and quite childish, often unintentionally drooling sluggishly, and hates bathing, doesn't like washing hands, and prefers to sleep. Hobby is watching TV. The friendship with SpongeBob is the best; and often encourages SpongeBob to do some dangerous actions, often getting each other into trouble.</p>

          <h2>Squidward Tentacles</h2>
          <p>The big-nosed octopus, easily angry and snobby, is quite narcissistic and thinks he has artistic talents. The eyes are bald, but once had long yellow curly hair. Live in a house that resembles a portrait of an Easter Island figure. Worked as a counter clerk at the "Krab King Restaurant", but didn't like his job, like playing the clarinet and painting self-portraits in various styles. Hates SpongeBob and Patrick, occasionally agrees with SpongeBob, but usually when it's to his own advantage.</p>

          <h2>Sandy</h2>
          <p>A female squirrel from Texas who is a scientist, explorer and inventor. Loves sports (especially karate and sandboarding) and science, and is a rodeo champion. Since squirrels are land creatures and need to breathe air, they must wear space suits and helmets on the seabed. Undersea tree houses usually live under a large circular tempered glass protective cover. The internal environment is the same as that on land, and the seasons can be rotated; if marine life enters, it must wear a helmet filled with water.</p>

          <h2>Gary the Snail</h2>
          <p>SpongeBob's pet snail has the ability to understand natural language and communicate. Although it is a snail, it occasionally wears cloth shoes, so there are hidden feet at the bottom. The inner shell holds pictures of some of SpongeBob's stuff snails, a clock for eating, and slime. The shell is attached with a parachute mechanism. If something gets stuck at the bottom, it will bite because of discomfort. Hate bathing. In dreams, he can use natural language to talk, and his IQ is even higher than SpongeBob SquarePants. He is a philosopher.</p>
